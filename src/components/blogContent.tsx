      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">How to Choose the Right Domain for Your Brand</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Your domain name is often the first interaction potential customers have with your brand online. It's your digital address, your identity, and a critical part of your marketing strategy. Here's how to choose the perfect domain name for your business.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1. Keep It Short and Simple</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">The best domain names are short, memorable, and easy to type. Aim for 6-14 characters if possible. Shorter domains are easier to remember, less prone to typos, and look cleaner on business cards and marketing materials.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Make It Brandable</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Your domain should reflect your brand identity. It should be unique, catchy, and give people an idea of what you do. Avoid generic terms that could apply to any business. Think about domains like "Spotify" or "Google" - they're unique, memorable, and ownable.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Use the Right Extension</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">While .com is still the gold standard, don't be afraid to use other extensions like .io for tech companies, .co for startups, or .design for creative agencies. However, if your .com is available and affordable, it's usually the safest choice.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. Avoid Numbers and Hyphens</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Numbers and hyphens can create confusion. When spoken aloud, people won't know if you mean "2" or "two," and hyphens are often forgotten or misplaced. Stick to letters only for maximum clarity.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5. Check Trademark Availability</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Before finalizing your domain, search the USPTO trademark database to ensure you're not infringing on existing trademarks. This can save you from legal issues and forced rebranding down the line.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">6. Think Long-Term</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Your domain should have staying power. Avoid trendy terms or references that might become dated. Choose a name that will grow with your business and remain relevant for years to come.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">7. Test It Out</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Say your domain out loud. Text it to friends. See how it looks in writing. Make sure it's easy to communicate verbally and doesn't have any unfortunate double meanings or awkward letter combinations.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Top 5 Things Businesses Forget When Launching Online</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Launching a website is exciting, but many businesses rush through the process and overlook critical elements that can make or break their online success. Here are the top 5 things businesses commonly forget:</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">1. Mobile Optimization</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Over 60% of web traffic comes from mobile devices, yet many businesses still design primarily for desktop. A website that looks great on desktop but breaks on mobile will lose more than half your potential customers. Always test your site on multiple devices and screen sizes before launch.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>The Fix:</strong> Use responsive design frameworks and test on real devices, not just browser emulators. Check loading speeds on mobile networks, as slow sites lead to high bounce rates.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">2. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Many businesses build beautiful websites but forget to optimize them for search engines. Without proper SEO, your site won't rank in search results, and potential customers won't find you organically.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>The Fix:</strong> Include meta descriptions, title tags, alt text for images, and a clear site structure. Create quality content with relevant keywords. Submit your sitemap to Google Search Console.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. Clear Call-to-Actions (CTAs)</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Your website might be beautiful and informative, but if visitors don't know what action to take next, they'll simply leave. Many sites lack clear, compelling CTAs that guide users toward conversion.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>The Fix:</strong> Every page should have a clear primary action - whether it's "Contact Us," "Get a Quote," "Shop Now," or "Learn More." Make buttons prominent, use action-oriented language, and place them strategically throughout your site.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4. Contact Information and Trust Signals</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Surprisingly, many businesses forget to make their contact information easily accessible. Hidden or hard-to-find contact details raise red flags for potential customers and harm credibility.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>The Fix:</strong> Display your phone number, email, and physical address prominently (ideally in the header or footer). Include trust signals like customer testimonials, security badges, professional associations, and certifications.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">5. Analytics and Tracking</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Launching without analytics is like driving blindfolded. You won't know how many visitors you're getting, where they're coming from, what pages they visit, or where they drop off. This data is crucial for improving your site and marketing.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>The Fix:</strong> Set up Google Analytics before launch. Install tracking pixels for any paid advertising you plan to run. Create conversion goals to measure success. Review your analytics regularly and use insights to optimize your site.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Bonus: Website Maintenance Plan</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Many businesses think the job is done once the site launches. They forget about updates, security patches, content refreshes, and regular backups. A neglected website can become a security risk and provide a poor user experience.</p>
      
      <p className="mt-6 font-medium">At Dark Mesa Hosting, we include all these essential elements in every website package and offer ongoing maintenance to keep your site secure, fast, and effective. Launch the right way from day one.</p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Why Having a Business Website Helps</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">In 2025, not having a website for your business is like not having a phone number. It's not just nice to have - it's essential. Here's why every business, regardless of size, needs a professional online presence.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">24/7 Accessibility</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Your website never sleeps. While your physical location has opening hours, your website is always available for customers to learn about your services, browse products, or contact you. This means you can generate leads and make sales even when you're closed.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Credibility and Professionalism</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">84% of consumers believe a business with a website is more credible than one with only a social media page. A professional website signals that you're a legitimate, established business. It's often the first place potential customers go to verify your authenticity.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Cost-Effective Marketing</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Compared to traditional advertising, a website is incredibly cost-effective. Once built, your website continues to market your business 24/7 for a fraction of the cost of print ads, billboards, or TV commercials. With good SEO, you can attract organic traffic for years.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Customer Insights</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">With analytics tools, your website provides valuable data about your customers - who they are, what they're interested in, how they found you, and what makes them convert. This information is gold for refining your marketing strategy and improving your offerings.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Competitive Advantage</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">If your competitors have websites and you don't, you're already behind. Consumers research online before making purchase decisions, and if they can't find you, they'll find your competition. A website levels the playing field, allowing small businesses to compete with larger companies.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Control Your Narrative</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Social media platforms can change their algorithms, suspend accounts, or shut down entirely. With your own website, you control the message, the design, and the user experience. You're not at the mercy of third-party platform changes.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Showcase Products and Services</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">A website gives you unlimited space to showcase your offerings in detail. Include high-quality images, detailed descriptions, pricing, testimonials, and case studies. You can update this information instantly without reprinting expensive materials.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Generate Leads</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Contact forms, email signup boxes, chatbots, and call-to-action buttons turn website visitors into leads. Your website becomes a lead generation machine, working around the clock to fill your sales pipeline.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Local SEO Benefits</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">For local businesses, a website is crucial for appearing in "near me" searches and Google Maps results. Properly optimized, your website helps customers in your area find you when they're searching for the services you offer.</p>
      
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Scale Your Business</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">A website allows you to reach beyond your local area. You can serve customers nationwide or even globally without opening additional physical locations. This dramatically increases your potential customer base and revenue opportunities.</p>
      
      <p className="mt-6 font-medium">Ready to establish your online presence? Dark Mesa Hosting makes it easy and affordable to get a professional website that works for your business 24/7. Start from just $249 and be online in under a week.</p>
